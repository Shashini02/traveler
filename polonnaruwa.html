              <h2><strong>Ancient city of Polonnaruwa</strong></h2>
              <p>The ancient city of Polonnaruwa was Sri Lanka's second ancient city. It features some of the most significant architectural treasures of the time, including palaces, Hindu temples, Buddhist monasteries, and dagobas. The site can be visited in a day. The best way to see all of the attractions is to hire a bicycle and ride between the ruins.</p>

                  <p><strong> In 993, Anuradhapura, Sri Lanka's first major capital, was taken over by Chola invaders. They moved to Polonnaruwa, and eventually, King Vijayabahu 1 of the Sinhalese Kingdom took over as the capital of the new state. For over 70 years, the Cholas had been establishing a presence in this region. <br> The following kings, namely Nissankamalla and Parakramabahu 1, greatly improved the city and made it a royal capital for over 200 years. Unfortunately, after the South Indians returned, Polonnaruwa fell into ruin. It was relocated to a safer location, which is now known as Colombo. </strong></p>

                  <p><strong>The Polonnaruwa archaeological site is located in Sri Lanka's North Western Province, which is part of the country's historical Cultural Triangle. It is approximately 230 kilometers from Colombo and is a two-hour drive from Anuradhapura. The ruins can be visited when travelling to the east coast or during a day trip from Pasikudha.</strong></p>

                <section class="p3">
                  <p><strong>The Royal Palace is a massive mansion that once stood seven stories high. It is also known to have features such as an Audience Hall that was adorned with carved elephants, and the Royal Baths. The Quadrangle is also known to have some of Sri Lanka's most significant religious artifacts. <br> The most significant area of ruins at Polonnaruwa is known to be the Vatadage, which features a circular relic house that's equipped with four beautifully preserved Buddhas.Other notable dagobas that can be found in the city include the Kiri Vihara, which has built for one of Parakramabahu's wives, and the Menik Vihara, which is a massive red brick structure that's 55 meters high. The Lankatilaka shrine also sits within the Alahana Pirivena, and there's a massive headless Buddha carved out of the end wall. <br> The four Buddhas that can be found at the Vatadage are still in incredibly good condition. They're carved out of a single slab of granite, and the natural marbling of the stone helps create their graceful carvings. Another notable building that can be found at the site is the Shiva Devale Number1. It's currently almost completely finished.</strong></p>
