Unfortunately, this tragic event eventually led to the death of the king. <br> The heir to the throne was King Kashyapa, but he had taken over after his brother, King Moggallana, was deposed. Because of this, Kashyapa built the fortress to protect himself. He did this to ensure that his brother would not return to reclaim his throne. The fortress was constructed with a mordern technology. The colorful frescod on the walls of the Sigiriya rock are a testimony to the construction of the fortress. <br> After defeating Kashyapa, the fortress was destroyed. It used to be a Buddhist monastery, but following the palace's destruction, it was turned into a Buddhist monastery. In 1831, the Sigiriya rock was discovered by Europeans. British army officer Jonathan Forbes was on his way to Polonnaruwa when he came across the fortress.
